# fac18-projects-gallery

A site showcasing all the amazing projects created by FAC18, the 18th Cohort of Founders and Coders.

In weeks 1-8 we built projects in teams of 4 in a day and a half, followed by code review and presentations to the rest of the cohort about our approach, challenges encountered and what we learnt!

Huge thanks to Jan @crianonim for allowing us to fork the excellent [FAC-17 projects gallery](https://github.com/fac-17/fac17-projects-gallery) :smiley:

### Guide to updating

1. git clone yada yada. go to the data.js file and scrollllll down. Way down.
2. edit the data for your week; it should be v intuitive - uncomment and replace data with ours, use previous week as a guide
3. save project images at 816px x 585px in the assets folder

Thanks! :sparkles:
