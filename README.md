# fac18-projects-gallery

A site showcasing all the amazing projects created by FAC18, the 18th Cohort of Founders and Coders. 

In weeks 1-8 we built projects in teams of 4 in a day and a half, followed by code review and presentations to the rest of the cohort about our approach, challenges encountered and what we learnt! 

Huge thanks to Jan @crianonim for allowing us to fork the excellent ![FAC-17 projects gallery](https://github.com/fac-17/fac17-projects-gallery) :smiley:
