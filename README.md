# FAC20 Projects Gallery

In FAC17 [Jan](https://www.github.com/crianonim) had the wonderful idea (and initiative) to create a Project Gallery for everything that was created throughout the course. This is a fork of his original repo so that we can build on his work to create the same thing for FAC21! :smiley: Remember, this is your repo so if you want to improve on it, change the CSS, try different functionality, do it! :star:

**NOTE:** The code is currently an exact fork and needs some editing. I will try to remove the current data and replace with some placeholders/examples, but after that it's up to you, FAC21! - Oliver :hearts:

### Guide to updating (written by [Reda](https://github.com/redahq) from FAC18)

1. git clone yada yada. go to the data.js file and scrollllll down. Way down.
2. edit the data for your week; it should be v intuitive - uncomment and replace data with ours, use previous week as a guide
3. save project images at 816px x 585px in the assets folder

Thanks! :sparkles:
