# fac17-projects-gallery

I started playing with the idea I suggested at our week 3 SGC to create a gallery with links to all our projects.

This is my initial proposition. If anyone cares, just clone and commit your changes, especially the css and design.

I had an idea to completely separate data from functionality and look (Model View Controlller pattern).
All data is in data.js. Atm it's just week3 and some random data otherwise. I also only added my week3 team to people section.
Anyone can edit and update this file, just please have a look how I organised it.
